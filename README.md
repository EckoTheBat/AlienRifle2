# AlienRifle2
﻿﻿Ever been to the bottom floor of the big alien gun and noticed that smaller alien gun in the glass case and said to yourself:

"Damn that thing looks cool I wanna shoot stuff with it"

Well now you can! In survival mode, either go to the QEP and scan the rifle to unlock the blueprint (if you have already scanned the rifle, dont fear, the blueprint will unlock itself), or use the command 'unlock alienrifleweapon' to get it automatically.

But be warned, once you unlock the recipie, it will still require a Stasis Rifle to build it at the modification station and an Ion-based power source to function...
Once you have it, enjoy your awesome gun! Go up agains reapers... if you dare, or if you're too lazy to smash those resource deposits, this bad boy will make short work of them. Simply right click to fire, or tap F to use the weapon's built in sonar pulse.

The gun will automatically disable itself when inside bases or submarines, to prevent unsafe operation.
